✨ Overview    
1) MVTC is an R package for simulating and fitting matrix-variate statistical models, with dedicated support for:
2) Matrix-Variate Normal (MVN) distributions (Function: EM.MatrixNC2)
3) Matrix-Variate Normal Handling missing and interval-censored observations (MVNC) (Function: EM.MatrixNC.cens3)
4) Matrix-Variate T Handling missing and interval-censored observations (MVTC) (Function: EM.MatrixtC.cens3): Allows estimation of the degrees of freedom
5) The folder "Applications" contains the two real data analyses included in the paper (under revision  on JMVA)
6) The file "Test File-Student.R" allows estimation of the parameters under MVNC and MVTC using simulated data with arbitrary structure (p and q) and sample size (n).
